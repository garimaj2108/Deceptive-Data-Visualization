# Project Outline 

This project highlights the "Gun Violence issue plaguing America. The country is gridlocked into a heated debate over whether Guns Save Lives OR Gun Control Saves Lives. I am trying to provide a small insight on this heated topic through my data visualizations via comparitive analysis.

# Project Motivation

The entire nation is curerntly mourning the Las Vegas and Texas mass shooting tragedies. Being an immigrant in America, the wide Gun use has always fascinated me. I thought this assignment to be a perfect opportunity to check two sides to a story. The nation seems to be divided in their opinion on Gun violence and I thought this would give me the perfect opportunity to explore a data visualization and its rebuttal.

For this assignment I am using the same data to magically pull two contrasting arguments, one that supports stricter Gun Laws and correlates them with lesser gun death rates and then an equally opposing argument where the same data displays a weak correlation between Stricter Laws and gun death rates.

# Claim - Gun Control Saves Lives

The scale of America’s gun violence epidemic is not a surprise to anyone. Whether its mass shootings, homicides or suicides. 2017 brought one of the worst mass shooting in the country’s history, Las Vegas was drowned in sorrow with a mass shooting of epic proportions, with 59 people dead and 527 injured, followed by Texas church mass shooting which killed 26 people. More than 20,000 people kill themselves with a gun every year, and over one million Americans have been victims of gun violence in the past decade.

Gun violence takes a number of different forms, and so do its solutions. No one policy will stop every shooting, but what we do know—because our research shows it, year after year—is that when taken in the aggregate, smart gun laws have a significant impact on public safety. They save lives.

The premise is simple, assess every state’s gun law grades and compares those grades with the state’s most recent gun death rate. Consistently, there seems to be a powerful correlation: "States with stronger laws have fewer gun deaths per capita" while "States with weaker laws have more gun deaths". 

# Audience Needs

Any American can rattle off a list of cities that have been scarred by Gun violence: Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Orlando, San Bernardino, Colorado Springs …. That doesn’t even take into account the thousands Americans killed by guns in single-death murders, or the roughly 21,000 who take their own lives with firearms annually.

Today all Americans want is a way to stop the Gun Violence madness.

# Audience Wants

Americans would ideally want the flexibility to purchase firearms as when they please without any background checks or additional gun laws but without having to worry about mass shootings or homicides.

# Audience Fears

- Not enough laws / well thought laws to protect people against gun violence 
- Not enough background checks / No background checks while issuing guns
- Loss of life due to homicides or mass shootings by people who get unsolicited access to Guns
- Increased rate of Gun Violence in place of residence

# Metrics

The goal of these metrics are to provide insights into correlation between stricter gun laws and gun related deaths.

- Statewise Gun Law Grade 
- Statewise Gun Death Rate Rank
- Gun Ownership Rate
- Statewise Total Murders
- Statewise Total Murders by firearms
