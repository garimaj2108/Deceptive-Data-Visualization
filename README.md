# Claim - Gun Laws Save Lives

The scale of America’s gun violence epidemic is not a surprise to anyone. Whether its mass shootings, homicides or suicides. 2017 brought one of the worst mass shooting in the country’s history, Las Vegas was drowned in sorrow with a mass shooting of epic proportions, with 59 people dead and 527 injured, followed by Texas church mass shooting which killed 26 people. More than 20,000 people kill themselves with a gun every year, and over one million Americans have been victims of gun violence in the past decade.

Gun violence takes a number of different forms, and so do its solutions. No one policy will stop every shooting, but what we do know—because our research shows it, year after year—is that when taken in the aggregate, smart gun laws have a significant impact on public safety. They save lives.

The premise of the State Law Scorecard is simple, it assesses every state’s gun law grades, and compare those grades with the state’s most recent gun death rate. Consistently, there seems to be a powerful correlation: "States with stronger laws have fewer gun deaths per capita" while "States with weaker laws have more gun deaths".
